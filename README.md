This repository contains "all" of the code that runs my [personal website](http://3.137.218.70/about). My personal site runs on an AWS EC2 instance using react.

The public_website folder contains all of the front-end code which you can see on my website. In the my-app folder, I am working on developing a backed which will allow users to create accounts and sign in, among other things.
